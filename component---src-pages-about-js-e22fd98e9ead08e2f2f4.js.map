Our villa has\n      accommodation types for every traveler: a 5-bed dorm (with single beds -\n      no bunks), semi-private rooms, and full privates. All rooms have AC, high\n      quality mattresses, hot water, and a delicious breakfast is served every\n      morning. We are ready to help with anything you need, from motorbike\n      rentals, to arranging surf lessons.\n    </p>\n\n    <h1>Our pets</h1>\n    <p>\n      Bulan: The princess, the sassy, very first of our pets, Bulan was found in\n      a dumpster and brought to hostel by our guests. The rest is history...\n      Basically she is “the boss” of the hostel.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Loco: This big (for an Indonesian cat) dude has appeared one day, and\n      never left. Once a very scared cat, now Loco won’t miss the chance to\n      sleep on an empty lap by the pool.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Casper: Our handsome Carlos’ favorite thing is having belly rubs. As the\n      friendliest, and most attention seeking pet of our hostel, he is adored by\n      every guest.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Surya: Our only dog, she was adopted from the local shelter. This Balinese\n      beauty is usually found not inside, but around the hostel, playing in the\n      street and hanging out with neighbourhood dogs.\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
